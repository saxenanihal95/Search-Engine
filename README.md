# Search-Engine
A Simple Search Engine using nltk 

This is a very basic search engine which we build using the following steps :

Scraping Documents from any website

Then the text of the documents will go through
    removal of puntuations and stopwords
    singular words to plural

Store the final words(keywords) into the database(mysql)

Create a dictionary of the words(keywords)

Create a document which will contain lists of list and each list will be a document we scraped and list will contain the frequency(number) of words occured in that document.

Create Tf-Idf Model

Finally search a query in our model.
